# IT115-Web-Page
Group Project: In this assignment, students will work in groups on a project in order to practice our Github skills.  The project will be a web page and the topic should target the audience that is your cohort (classmates) and can proceed from your wiki project, or be entirely new.

Topic Selection: Since you'll be working in a new group, you can either choose to pick an entirely new topic for your web page, or build a web page to support a single point from one of your team's wiki.

Less is more: With a web audience, the more quickly we can get to the point, the better. Our goal is to improve the readability of the text by focusing and trimming it down so the material is concisem, scanable, and objective links to an external site..

To begin, find the point, then use an additive process: I recommend starting with a simple HTML template, bereft of navigation, etc.   Next, identify the most important point you'd like to make for your page.  Consider using PIE, point, illustration and explanation, both in your page in total, and in a perfect world, also in your paragraphs.  Here's a quick overview of PIE: Paragraph Development with PIELinks to an external site.

Find the point, state it simply and invert the pyramid: In order to write for the web there are several strategies we can use:

Invert the pyramid - Identify the main point in the first lines of the article on the page
Write simply - remove all redundant, confusing and complicated words
Write concisely - remove or re-write all redundant or confusing sentences
Use short sentences and paragraphs - shoot for 15 words per sentence, 3 sentences per paragraph
Link at end of paragraphs - write so outbound links in text are at the end of sentences to keep focus
Jakub Neilsen provides advice on the above in his article, Concise, Scanable and Objective: How to Write for the WebLinks to an external site.

Attribution, not necessarily MLA citation: Since the output this time is a web page and not a white paper, how we give credit to others is not as clearly mapped out and agreed upon.  While you can choose to use the MLA format for your web page, consider other advice about attribution of credit to others as noted in several websites linked in the next paragraph.  When we build a website of the pages you are creating, we'll need to agree to an attribution format, so be forewarned how this will ultimately play out may change.

Project Requirements

Project Document: Besides your finished project as stored in your team's Github repo, you must also work together as a team on a shared project document that will provide a point of contact for your team members as well as information and resources.

Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:

2/12/2016: (Bill) Researched genesis of UNIX at Bell Labs.  Linked potential resources on project document.  (.5 hours)

Each member should place the most recent work at the top so that each work log entry descends in chronological order. 

Work on Branches and use Pull Requests: Multiple branches and developers working on the project IS NOT a requirement. IF only one developer is working on the code you do not need branches (though branching/pull requests are recommended regardless). If multiple developers are working on the project, all work should be done on branches and should be followed by a pull request. Consider having one or more persons in your group be in charge of approving pull requests and merging. 

Roles & Responsibilities

Since this is a large project, consider splitting up the responsibilities so everyone is productive.

Roles: Be sure the work to be done is split up as evenly as possible, with each member taking on multiple rolesLinks to an external site. as required. Please write each team member's role next to their name in the contributor's list on the project document. These roles could fulfill duties such as:

Research: Research specific aspects of the project goal and place info and links on the project document
Outline: Outline relevant tasks and topics
Write: Write and re-write key sections project as commits.
Develop: The output of the content will be web pages.  Have someone in charge of Hosting, FTP and any HTML or JavaScript issues if applicable
Design: The content must have a look and feel, even if basic.  Have someone in charge of the CSS and look and feel
Edit: Edit for cogency, clarity and flow
Review: Look over the work of others to be sure it meets the expectations of all
Project Management: Making sure all items are completed on time, and no important pieces are missing
Visuals: Are diagrams, pictures or charts important to your project?  If so, this could be a role on your team
Repo Management: In charge of approving pull requests, making sure issues are tracked and addressed
Submission: Your submission for this assignment is the link to your project document, which should have links to all relevant information and a link to your repo!  Each team member will submit the link separately, even though the link will be the same for each student on your team.

Special Midnight Submission Time on Due Date: While normally submissions are at the beginning of a class, the due date of this assignment is midnight in order to allow teams to work together in lab time during class on the due date.
